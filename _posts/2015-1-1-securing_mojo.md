title: Securing "Mojo"
---

We live in a startup culture and all around us new businesses are popping up everywhere and Asheville is no exception! With the staggering amount of new ventures taking place, people need a place that not only promotes creativity, but also productivity. 

Enter Coworking Spaces...

They are great locations for people to rent a desk in a social atmosphere that is conducive to the entrepreneurial workflow. These spaces provide access to things that fresh startups need, such as desk space, Internet access and hopefully plenty of coffee.  Coworking locations offer its clients a great environment to network with other startups and individuals that are trying to build their companies from the ground up.

Most Coworking offerings are designed for easy and convenient access to resources such as the Internet, printers, etc.  While easy and convenient access to the Internet is great for clients, it does not come without its inherent risks.

It is not uncommon to find very basic network solutions implemented at coworking environments. No big deal, right? They just need to make sure users can get online and print right? 

Well, maybe except for those really private emails containing the latest design specs for the next big app floating around the network or any other sensitive information that needs to stay private.

You see, one of the biggest issues that we have found with these shared spaces is that the networks were designed for ease of use with little focus on securing the data or clients within the network.  It must be a priority to have an understanding that client data and privacy is uniquely valuable to them.

Not many startups that utilize coworking spaces have the luxury or budget for a dedicated security team to monitor and protect their data right out of the gate. Coworking environments taking the initiative to provide secure network access to their clients is a major step in the right direction!

Recently the team at mountainsec, LLC partnered with one of Asheville's premiere work spaces, [Mojo Coworking](https://mojocoworking.spaces.nexudus.com/en/about "Mojo Cowroking"), to redesign and implement a network architecture with security at its core.

Starting from the ground up, we made improvements to the network while still meeting the goal of providing easy access for members.

By implementing fundamental security practices, mountainsec was able to provide Mojo with a solution that offers advanced network segmentation and added privacy from other users.

We're looking forward to further working with Mojo to make sure they have one of the most secure office environments that Western North Carolina has to offer!
